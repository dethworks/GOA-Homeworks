      Machu Picchu is an ancient Inca citadel located in the Andes
      Mountains of Peru, near the city of Cusco. Often called the "Lost
      City of the Incas," it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of
      the New Seven Wonders of the World, renowned for its sophisticated
      architecture and breathtaking location.

    <p>
      Machu Picchu sits at an elevation of approximately 2,430 meters
      (7,970 feet) on a mountain ridge. It overlooks the Urubamba River
      valley, surrounded by lush, steep slopes and misty cloud forests,
      making it an exceptional example of human adaptation to the natural
      environment. The sites location helped it remain hidden from the
      Spanish conquistadors, preserving its unique features for centuries.

      Built in the mid-15th century under the Inca emperor Pachacuti,
      Machu Picchu served multiple purposes, including a royal estate,
      religious site, and a center for agricultural and astronomical
      studies. The site was abandoned around the time of the Spanish
      conquest in the 16th century, remaining largely unknown to the
      outside world until it was brought to international attention by
      American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911.

      The architecture of Machu Picchu is notable for its dry-stone
      construction method, with stones cut so precisely that no mortar was
      needed to hold them together. Key structures include the Temple of
      the Sun, Intihuatana (a ritual stone associated with astronomical
      observations), the Temple of the Three Windows, and the main
      residential and agricultural areas. These structures are laid out to
      align with celestial events, reflecting the Incas sophisticated
      knowledge of astronomy.

      Machu Picchus layout is divided into the agricultural terraces on
      the outskirts, used to grow crops, and the urban area, containing
      temples, plazas, and residential areas. The terraces also helped
      stabilize the mountain slope and manage water drainage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, Machu Picchu attracts millions of visitors each year, leading
      to significant conservation challenges. Efforts are ongoing to
      protect the site from erosion, environmental degradation, and
      overcrowding, balancing tourism with preservation to maintain its
      cultural and historical value for future generations.
