    First Blood is a 1982 American action film directed by Ted Kotcheff
     and co-written by and starring Sylvester Stallone as Vietnam War 
     veteran John Rambo. It co-stars Richard Crenna as Rambo's mentor Sam
      Trautman and Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle. It is the first 
      installment in the Rambo franchise, followed by Rambo: First Blood 
      Part II.

The film is based on the 1972 novel First Blood by David Morrell, which
 many directors and studios had unsuccessfully attempted to adapt in the
  1970s. In the film, Rambo is a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam 
  veteran who must rely on his combat and survival skills when a series of 
  brutal events results in him having to survive a massive manhunt by 
  police and government troops near the small town of Hope, Washington.

  First Blood was released in the United States on October 22, 1982.
   Initial reviews were mixed, but the film was a box office success, 
   grossing $125.2 million and becoming the 13th highest grossing film at
    the domestic box office and the seventh highest grossing film 
    worldwide. In 1985, it also became the first Hollywood blockbuster to 
    be released in China, holding the record for the largest number of 
    tickets sold for an American film until 2018. Since its release, it 
    has been reappraised by critics, with many highlighting the roles of 
    Stallone, Dennehy and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential 
    film in the action genre.

    Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports drama film starring, written and
     directed by Sylvester Stallone. The film is the sequel to Rocky
      III (1982) and the fourth installment in the Rocky film series. It
       also stars Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Brigitte
        Nielsen, and Dolph Lundgren. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone)
         confronts Ivan Drago (Lundgren), a Soviet boxer responsible for
          another personal tragedy in Balboa's life.


Development for a fourth Rocky film began soon after the success of Rocky
 III. Principal photography began in 1984, with filming locations
  including Philadelphia, Wyoming, and Vancouver. Rocky IV was Lundgren's
   American film debut, and Stallone's last directorial effort until 2006;
    they engaged in authentic punching in their fight scenes, which led to
     Stallone being admitted to intensive care. Filming also featured new 
     special effects and bona fide and groundbreaking sport methods and 
     equipment, some of which were years removed from public use. Rocky IV 
     is known for its strong Cold War themes, as well as its successful 
     theme songs "Burning Heart" and "Living in America".


Rocky IV premiered in Los Angeles on November 21, 1985, and was 
theatrically released in the United States by MGM/UA Entertainment Co.
 under its United Artists label on November 27. The film received mixed
  reviews, with praise for Drago's credibility as a villain, but 
  criticised the predictable screenplay. Scholars note that Drago's 
  ultimate defeat and the Soviet crowd's embrace of Rocky represented the 
  dissolution of the Soviet Union, while others criticized the film as 
  propaganda through its Cold War themes and negative portrayals of 
  Russians

    Over the Top is a 1987 American sports drama film starring Sylvester
     Stallone. It was produced and directed by Menahem Golan, and its 
     screenplay was written by Stirling Silliphant and Stallone. The 
     original music score was composed by Giorgio Moroder. The main 
     character, Lincoln Hawk, played by Stallone, is a long-haul truck 
     driver who tries to win back his estranged son, Michael, while 
     becoming a champion arm wrestler.

<h3>Lore</h3>
<pre>
    Lincoln Hawk is a truck driver who also arm wrestles for extra cash.
     His estranged wife Christina, who is suffering from heart disease,
      asks that Hawk pick up their young son Michael from military school
       and develop a relationship with him (Hawk had left them ten years
        earlier). Michael's wealthy grandfather - Christina's father,
         Jason Cutler - believes that Hawk has no right to be in his
          grandson's life. Michael distrusts Hawk initially and treats him
           with contempt.


Over the course of a trip from Colorado to California, the two bond. When
 they arrive at the hospital, Christina has died from complications during
  surgery. Michael blames Hawk for delaying his arrival and leaves for his
   grandfather's estate. An attempt to retrieve Michael ends with Hawk
    being arrested when he resorts to ramraiding the gated mansion.
     Michael visits Hawk in jail and forgives him but says he feels safer
      living with his grandfather. As a condition of charges being
       dropped, Hawk is obliged to sign over custody of Michael to Cutler.

  Cobra is a 1986 American action drama film directed by George P.
   Cosmatos and written by Sylvester Stallone, who stars in the titular
    role. The film, which is loosely based on the novel A Running Duck by
     Paula Gosling (later published as Fair Game and filmed under that
      title in 1995), co-stars Reni Santoni, Brigitte Nielsen and Andrew
       Robinson. Cobra follows Lt. Marion "Cobra" Cobretti, who
        investigates a string of violent crimes and also protects a 
        witness targeted by the perpetrators.


Cobra is the final film which featured the collaboration between Stallone
 and Nielsen after Rocky IV (1985) and until Creed II (2018), and the only 
 film the pair are both featured in while married to one another in real
  life. The script was largely inspired by Stallone's original script for
   Beverly Hills Cop (1984).


Cobra was released to generally negative reviews with criticism on its 
excessive violence and overuse of genre tropes, but it was a box office 
success and also has since been considered as a cult classic.
