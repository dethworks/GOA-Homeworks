      <pre><b>Black is a color that results from the absence or complete 
        absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, without 
        hue, like white and grey. It is often used symbolically or 
        figuratively to represent darkness. Black and white have often 
        been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark 
        Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. Since the 
        Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and 
        authority, and for this reason it is still commonly worn by judges
         and magistrates.</b>

        Boxing is a combat sport and martial art. Taking place in a boxing
         ring, it involves two people usually wearing protective 
         equipment, such as protective gloves, hand wraps, and 
         mouthguardsthrowing punches at each other for a predetermined 
         amount of time.
Although the term "boxing" is commonly attributed to <u>western</u>boxing, in 
which only fists are involved, it has developed in different ways in 
different geographical areas and cultures of the World.

    green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly

      he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An

      <pre><b>Arm wrestling (also spelled armwrestling) is a sport with two 
        opponents who face each other with their bent elbows placed on a 
        table and hands firmly gripped, who then attempt to force the 
        opponent's hand down to the table top ("pin" them). The sport is 
        often casually used to demonstrate the stronger person between two 
        or more people. Arm wrestling is an ancient sport that was revived 
        in the 1950s in the United States. In September 1962, the first 
        world wrestling championship was held in Petaluma, California, as 
        this wrestling was called (literally, “wrist wrestling”).</b></pre>
