The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a
small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species
of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly
kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human
contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the
cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.
It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night
vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a
solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes
vocalizationsâ€”including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
grunting as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and
perceives pheromones.

it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late

development of agriculture. The dog was the first species to be
domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that due to their long association
with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and
gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate
for other canids.</em></strong></pre>

The Turtle
is a reptile with a hard shell that protects it from predators. Turtles are reptiles
of the order Testudines, characterized by a special shell developed mainly from
their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira
(side-necked turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden-necked turtles), which differ in
the way the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently extinct species of
turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are
found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of
the ocean. Like other amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe air
and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.

The Lion

Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short,
rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually
dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a
social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some
lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions
typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

The Elephant
is the largest land animal. Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species
are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest
elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving
members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include
mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk,
tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. The trunk is
prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived
from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.
The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.
African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears
and convex or level backs.

The Donkey

domesticated equine. It derives from the African wild ass, Equus africanus, and may be
classified either as a subspecies thereof, Equus africanus asinus, or as a separate
species, Equus asinus. It was domesticated in Africa some 5000 to 7000 years ago, and
has been used mainly as a working animal since that time.

There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries,
where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. While working donkeys are often
associated with those living at or below subsistence, small numbers of donkeys or asses
are kept for breeding, as pets, and for livestock protection in developed countries.

The Wolf
(Canis lupus) is a powerful and highly social animal. The wolf (Canis lupus; pl.: wolves),
also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a canine native to Eurasia and North America.
More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and
dingo, though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild
subspecies. The wolf is the largest wild extant member of the family Canidae, and is
further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as
a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller
Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.
The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the
arctic region may be nearly all white.

The Tiger

genus Panthera and the largest living cat species native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body

It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two
subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate
broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and
subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger
is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush.

The Alligator
</mark></b>
is a large reptile found in the swamps and rivers. An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large
reptile in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae of the order Crocodilia. The two
extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A.
sinensis). Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains.
Alligators first appeared during the late Eocene epoch about 37 million years ago.

The name "alligator" is likely an anglicized form of *el lagarto*, the Spanish term for "the
lizard," which early Spanish explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator. Early
English spellings of the name included allagarta and alagarto.

hoofed ruminant ungulate of the family Cervidae (informally the deer family). Cervidae is
divided into subfamilies Cervinae (which includes, among others, muntjac, elk (wapiti),
red deer, and fallow deer) and Capreolinae (which includes, among others, reindeer (caribou),
white-tailed deer, roe deer, and moose). Male deer of almost all species (except the water
deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. These antlers are
bony extensions of the skull and are often used for combat between males.
