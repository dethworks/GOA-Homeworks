 Rocky Balboa is a 2006 American sports drama film starring, written and 
directed by Sylvester Stallone in his first film as director since 1985. 
It is the sequel to Rocky V (1990) and the sixth installment in the Rocky 
film series. The film co-stars Burt Young and Antonio Tarver in his only 
acting role. In the film, Rocky Balboa (Stallone), now an aging small 
restaurant owner, is challenged to an exhibition fight by hothead young 
boxer Mason Dixon (Tarver).


Development for a sixth Rocky film began after Stallone expressed regret of the 
outcome of Rocky V, which was viewed as a disappointing conclusion to the end of the 
franchise. Rocky Balboa includes references to characters and objects from previous 
installments, and Stallone was inspired by recent personal struggles and triumphs 
when writing the film. It is Stallone's first directorial effort since Rocky IV 
(1985) and is Tarver's only feature film appearance. Principal photography began in 
December 2005 and lasted until January 2006, with filming locations including Las 
Vegas, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In contrast to previous entries in the 
franchise, the fight choreography in Rocky Balboa was less scripted, featuring real 
punches thrown by Stallone and Tarver.</b></tt></span>

Rocky Balboa, now sixty years old, is retired 
 from boxing and lives a quiet life as a widower, having 
lost his wife Adrian to cancer four years prior. He now 
runs a small, but successful, Italian restaurant named 
after her, where he regales patrons with tales from his 
past. He also battles personal demons involving his grief 
over Adrian's death and his eroding relationship with his 
son Robert, now a moderately successful young corporate 
accountant. Paulie, Rocky's best friend and 
brother-in-law, continues to support him whenever he can, 
but is guilt-ridden over his past poor treatment toward 
 his late sister and accuses Rocky of living in the past.


Late one night, Rocky meets a woman named Marie, who was 
once a troublesome young girl Rocky had escorted home 
thirty years ago. Marie now is a single parent of a 
teenage son named Stephenson and nicknamed "Steps", born 
out of wedlock. Rocky's relationship with Marie quickly 
blossoms over the following weeks and he meets and bonds 
with Steps, providing him with a much-needed buffer for his anguish. </span></tt></b>
