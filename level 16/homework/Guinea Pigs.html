Guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are small, gentle rodents originally 
from South America. They are popular pets due to their friendly nature, 
curious personalities, and ease of care. Guinea pigs are social animals 
and thrive in pairs or groups. They have a lifespan of 5 to 7 years on 
average and require a diet rich in hay, fresh vegetables, and vitamin C 
to stay healthy. Their adorable squeaks, chirps, and gentle behavior 
make them beloved companions for pet owners worldwide.
