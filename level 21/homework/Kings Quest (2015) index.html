      <h2><i>Wiki</i></h2>
      <pre>
<b>King's Quest is an episodic video game series developed by The
Odd Gentlemen and published by Activision under the Sierra
Entertainment brand name for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3,
PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. It is a new re-imagining
of the long-running King's Quest series. While it is an
adventure game like the previous games in the series, the
interface is not fully point-and-click (the PC version only
uses point-and-click for the dialogue and first person
scenes).
The game is one of several attempts at resurrecting or rebooting
the King's Quest franchise since 1998, and its first chapter was
released some 32 years after King's Quest I. The new chapters
are seen as neither a remake nor necessarily a sequel but a 
"re-imagining" (the original games are considered to be part of
the canon of the new series, as each chapter will take place
between those games, but previous games may be reinterpreted 
in completely new ways).</b>

      <pre>
        <b>
Unlike the classic King's Quest video games, the new King's Quest is not a
point-and-click adventure. Instead, it is an adventure game that tasks
players to control Graham, who ventures to different places to
become a knight. The movement of Graham can be completely controlled
by players. According to Matt Korba, the game's creative director,
the game's controls focuses on "one-button context". As a result, the
game does not have any complicated interfaces or controls.
Throughout the game, players can interact with different objects in
the environment. For instance, players can pick up, gather, and
inspect different scenery items. They can switch to first-person
perspective when inspecting them. The game is narrated by the elderly
King Graham and his granddaughter Gwendolyn. Players' actions in the
game change the narrative. For instance, performing certain actions
unlocks additional dialogue. When players make wrong decisions and
die, Graham replies with phrases such as "That's what would have
happened if I did that", before players re-spawn. Players also make
decisions throughout the game that are divided into three different
approaches, bravery, wisdom, and compassion. Actions performed by
players have consequences and impact the game's story, and as a
result, change the game's overall experience. Most of these choices
are game play-based. According to Korba, all the choices made by
Graham are heroic, and there is no way for players to build a "bad"
Graham.
