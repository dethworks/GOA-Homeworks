        <p>Ethnic Cleansing (also known as Ethnic Cleansing: The Game) is a 2002 first-person 
            shooter produced by the National Alliance, an American white supremacist and 
            neo-Nazi organization. The player controls one of three selectable characters, 
            including a Ku Klux Klan member and a neo-Nazi skinhead, and traverses two levels 
            to kill stereotypically depicted African Americans, Latinos, and Jews. Designed 
            to be politically incorrect and spread a white supremacist message, the game was 
            released through the National Alliance's record label, Resistance Records, on 
            Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2002. It was received negatively by anti-hate 
            organizations like the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and has been 
            considered as one of the most controversial and most racist games. Resistance 
            Records sought to release a series of games based on the novel The Turner Diaries 
            and published White Law in 2003.
