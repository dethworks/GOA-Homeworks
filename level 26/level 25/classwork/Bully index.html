Bully (released in the PAL region as Canis Canem Edit; Latin for "dog eat dog")
 is a 2006 action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar Vancouver and 
published by Rockstar Games. It was released on 17 October 2006 for the 
PlayStation 2. A remastered version of the game, subtitled Scholarship Edition, 
was developed by Mad Doc Software and released on 4 March 2008 for Xbox 360 and 
Wii, and on 21 October 2008 for Windows. Bully was re-released for PlayStation 4 
available via PlayStation Network on 22 March 2016. An updated version of the 
Scholarship Edition, titled Anniversary Edition, was developed by War Drum 
Studios and released for Android and iOS on 8 December 2016.


The game is played from a third-person perspective and its open world can be 
navigated on foot, skateboard, motor scooter, bicycle, or go-kart. Set in the 
fictional town of Bullworth, the single-player story follows juvenile delinquent 
student James "Jimmy" Hopkins, who is involuntarily enrolled at Bullworth Academy
boarding school for a year, and puts his efforts to rise through the ranks of 
the school system in order to put a stop to bullying. Players control Jimmy as 
he attempts to become more popular among the school's various "cliques", in 
addition to attending classes and completing various side missions. The 
Scholarship Edition includes a two-player competitive multiplayer mode that lets 
two players compete for the highest score in different classes.
