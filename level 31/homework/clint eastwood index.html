    In 1955 he made his debut as an actor in the film Francis in the Navybut he really 
    became known for his role of Rowdy Yates, a second foreman driver, on the television 
    series Rawhide (1959-1966). This had set the direction of his career for the time 
    being: Eastwood flourished in the western. He became famous thanks to A Fistful of 
    Dollars (1964), his first collaboration with director Sergio Leone. It was extended 
    with For a Few Dollars More in 1965 and in 1966 with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 
    According to some, the latter competes for the unofficial title 'best western ever' 
    with another Leone film: Once Upon a Time in the West.


The characters that Eastwood in spaghetti westerns (and later police films) portrayed 
his unyielding and have a sense of dry humor. His performances have also become iconic: 
a long stature, grim face and pensive eyes, a smoldering cigar in the corner of the 
mouth, runs smoothly, slowly through the scenes of the spaghetti westerns, while 
handling his revolver at careless speed.


In 1968, Eastwood abandoned his role as an unnamed cowboy. Between 1971 and 1988, he 
starred hard police officer Harry Callahan in five films Dirty Harry. The film Dirty 
Harry was inspired by the hunt for the Zodiac Killer. In between, he starred in several 
other films.
